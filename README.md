# The Odin Project -  Restaurant page
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
The page is a simple page created with JavaScript code. Styles are applied with classes that are in a CSS file. **Webpack** is used to bundle all the things together and to build the necessary files to "compile" the site.</br>

## Live site
GitHub Pages site: https://it-miez.github.io/Restaurant-Page-Project/
</br></br>

## Technologies used
**HTML** (form-inputs, input-element validations) </br>
**CSS** (styling, img+form side, flexbox, hover-effects, button colors, fonts)</br>
**JavaScript** (additional form-validation)</br></br>

## What I learned
I did a basic sign-up page with form-elements, CSS-styling and JavaScript. I refreshed my skills on forms as I have used them before and got better at doing UI for a simple register page.
